# BetterNeutralDash
Celeste hard-codes that dashing while not holding any directional keys makes you dash in the direction you're facing, instead of using the previously held direction. This mod makes the game instead use your last held direction.

Whether or not it's actually is up to each individual person ofc, I just prefer it myself :)
